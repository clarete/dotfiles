# My dot files

This repo is here because of two reasons: 1) It's easier to keep track
of the changes in my config files, 2) it's a good way to share nice
things I've done in the softwares I use.

## How to use it

## Automatically

There's a small helper script that install symlinks of all the available
files for you. To run it, issue the following commands:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt # optional for coloring
$ ./install
```

It's going to show you all the installed files. Don't worry about
backups. The `install` helper will do that for you. You can run it with
the `--help` flag to define where your files are going to be saved.

## Manually

If you don't trust my script, you can just copy the files that you want
to your home folder or symlink them.
