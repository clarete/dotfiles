# This is the emacs client I use, instead of calling emacs directly,
# cause I'm using the server mode.
#
# The trick here is the usage of the `-a` parameter, it sets the
# "alternative" editor if the client fails. This way, when I call it
# without an emacs server, the client itself will take care of spawning
# a new one.
